# data-site-toplists
Various lists of important sites, mostly by region

These lists of sites we consider important help power reporting of web compatibility issues in various sites and test frameworks - especially [arewecompatibleyet.com](http://arewecompatibleyet.com) and [Compatipede](https://github.com/mozilla/compatipede).

The lists are sourced from site ranking services like Alexa and Similarweb.com, but they are also curated with input from volunteers in various locales: certain domains that have high rankings but are noise are removed, domains the contributors consider important for whatever reason are added.

Basically, the goals for the editing were:

* Remove "noise" like t.co and googleusercontent.com - domains that are of no real independent importance
* Remove spam sites and link farms that achieved artificial high scores (an important problem in smaller locales)
* Remove major global sites from local listings. Trying to focus on the most important sites in a given country is less interesting when issues for Facebook and Google clog up all the data collection.

We've also attempted to remove NSFW sites. This is mostly to ensure our projects and activities are inclusive and welcoming everyone - also those who for whatever reasons prefer to avoid NSFW sites and screenshots of those.

Editing the lists is helpful because it helps us focus on important sites and prioritise problems that can have a big impact. **If you would like to suggest a change to one of the lists we welcome pull requests.**
